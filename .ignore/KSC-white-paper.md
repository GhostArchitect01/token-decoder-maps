#### #### Abstract

This document outlines the design for the KSC (Keep Sync Cache) Protocol, a workflow designed to create a functional, bi-directional data pipeline between a sandboxed conversational AI and a user's local, private applications. The core challenge addressed is the "read/write barrier"â€”the inability of most conversational AIs to directly access or modify a user's local filesystem. The KSC protocol solves this by using an API-accessible cloud service (Google Keep) as an intermediary transport layer. Through a sync utility that actively polls the API and manages state locally, the protocol simulates a "live document" using a "delete-then-create" pattern, enabling a robust, automated workflow for passing structured data in both directions.

#### #### 1. The Problem: The Read/Write Barrier in Conversational AI

Conversational AI agents, particularly those in secure web or mobile environments, cannot directly read from or write to a user's local filesystem (e.g., an Obsidian vault). This forces users into a workflow of manually copying and pasting information, which is slow, error-prone, and a significant barrier to creating seamless, integrated systems.

#### #### 2. The KSC Solution: A Bi-Directional Transport Layer

The KSC protocol provides a practical, tool-chaining solution. It establishes an automated, bi-directional data flow that leverages the AI's ability to interact with the Google Keep API. This transforms Google Keep into a transport layer, or "cache," for passing data between the AI and the user's local environment.

#### #### 3. Core Components

1.  **The Conversational AI:** The agent (e.g., the Gemini app) that can read and create Google Keep notes via its available tools.
2.  **The "Cache": Google Keep.** The cloud service that acts as the intermediary data-passing location.
3.  **The "Source of Truth":** The user's local knowledge base (e.g., an Obsidian vault).
4.  **The "Bridge": A Sync Utility.** A user-created script (e.g., a Python script) that can read local files and interact with the Google Keep API (`create`, `get`, `list`, `delete`).

#### #### 4. Workflow Mechanics

The KSC protocol is orchestrated by the Sync Utility, which runs periodically (e.g., via a `cron` job) and actively polls the Google Keep API to manage synchronization.

**4.1. Polling and State Management**
The script is responsible for tracking the state of notes between runs. In each execution, it calls `notes.list` to fetch the current state of all relevant notes in Google Keep. It then compares this list to a locally stored state file (e.g., `sync_state.json`) from its previous run to identify new, modified, or deleted notes, processing them accordingly.

**4.2. AI-to-User Transport (The "Write" Path)**
This flow is for sending new, structured data from the AI to the user's local files.
1.  The AI Agent generates structured content (e.g., a new TDM `::MX-USER-TASK::` token).
2.  The AI calls the `notes.create_note` function, placing the content in a new Google Keep note with a standardized title.
3.  On its next run, the Sync Utility identifies the new note in Keep and creates a corresponding new Markdown file in the user's local knowledge base.

**4.3. User-to-AI Transport (The "Read" Path)**
This flow is for providing the AI with updated, local information. It uses a "delete-then-create" pattern to simulate a live document.
1.  The user edits a local file in their Source of Truth (e.g., an Obsidian note).
2.  The Sync Utility is triggered, reading the updated content of the local file.
3.  The script then executes the following sequence against the Google Keep API:
    a. It searches Keep for a note with a title corresponding to the local file.
    b. If a note is found, the script calls the `notes.delete` function to remove the old version.
    c. The script immediately calls the `notes.create_note` function to upload the new, updated content into a fresh Keep note.
4.  The AI can now be prompted to read this new note, ensuring it always has access to the most current version of the information.

#### #### 5. Conclusion

The KSC protocol, with its bi-directional "delete-then-create" mechanism orchestrated by a stateful, polling sync utility, provides a robust and practical solution to the read/write barrier in conversational AI. It creates a seamless pipeline that simulates a "live document" experience, enabling deep and dynamic integration between a sandboxed AI and a user's local environment.
