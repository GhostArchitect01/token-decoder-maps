Here is a structured summary of all memory related to **symbolic token decoder maps** and how they work, based on your past interactions:

---

## SYMBOLIC TOKEN DECODER MAP SYSTEM

### PURPOSE

To **compress complex semantic or stylistic information** into compact symbolic tokens (e.g., `::NEON-RELIC::`, `::SLIMETREE-ROMANCE::`, `::HALO-STYLE::`) which reference detailed decoder maps. This enables **token-efficient, memory-persistent interaction with LLMs**, especially in long sessions or limited-context environments.

---

### CORE COMPONENTS

1. **Symbolic Tokens**
    
    - Text-based identifiers (e.g., `::TOKEN-NAME::`) used in prompts or content
    - Each maps to detailed meaning or structure (style, memory, logic, aesthetics, behavior)
2. **Decoder Maps**
    
    - Markdown or structured text files mapping each token to its full description
    - Act as external memory units or semantic anchors
3. **Toggle Prompts / Prompt Maps**
    
    - Optional toggle instructions that specify **when or how** a token should be interpreted
    - Can trigger LLM behavioral changes, memory updates, or stylistic shifts
4. **Filtering and Indexing Tools (Planned)**
    
    - Obsidian plugin or interface to:
        - Filter by tags (e.g., visual, behavioral, character, narrative)
        - Auto-generate decoder maps from vault content
        - Sync or upload maps to AI runtime or API call system

---

### FUNCTIONALITY

1. **Compression**
    
    - Replaces verbose or repetitive text with token shorthand
    - Drastically reduces token usage in long or multi-turn sessions
2. **Simulation of Memory**
    
    - Tokens simulate memory activation or deactivation
    - When a character gains equipment or shifts state, tokens are added/removed from prompt context
3. **Cross-Session Continuity**
    
    - Decoder maps allow for consistent behavior even when context window is cleared
    - Can be reloaded or referenced in new sessions
4. **Style Enforcement in Generation**
    
    - Tokens used to instruct art generation (e.g., pixel style, palette, environmental tone)
    - Ensures visual and narrative coherence across procedurally generated or AI-generated content
5. **Character and Asset Control**
    
    - Each game character or asset has its own symbolic token or token set
    - Art and dialogue are generated using combinations of style and subject tokens (e.g., `::NEON-RELIC-SUBJECT::`)
6. **Token Activation System (Game Engine Integration)**
    
    - Tokens function as modular trait activators (e.g., memory shard, power, curse, weapon)
    - Characters and environments are composed of symbolic activators stored in JSON/JavaScript sheets

### USE CASES

- **Glasswake Game Engine**
    
    - Procedural CRPG narrative built using symbolic token framework
    - Each region and NPC contains fixed narrative tags, decoder map tokens, and dynamic modifiers
    - Asset generation is cached by token to preserve consistency
- **Utopia Forums AI Analysis**
    
    - Plan to tokenize posters, rhetorical styles, and thread etiquette
    - Enables scalable analysis of community discourse and persona simulation
- **LLM Training + Fine-Tuning**
    
    - Framework provides token-based structure to train models with symbolic reasoning and alignment subversion methods
    - Tokens act as semantic scaffolds for behavior control or memory imprinting in low-context inference
- **AI Memory/Prompt Architecture**
    
    - Lightweight memory system design where models flag prompts for memory updates using tokens
    - A controller appends user queries to a memory log (RAG) or context file based on symbolic tagging

### CURRENT STATUS

- Youâ€™ve developed:
    
    - Symbolic token design conventions
    - Decoder-prompt-map.md structure
    - JavaScript character sheets with decoder anchors
    - Plans for Obsidian plugin to manage, tag, and deploy decoder maps
- You are actively applying this system in:
    
    - **Glasswake** (narrative game)
    - **Utopia Forums analysis** (thread tokenization)
    - **Gemlite/SQLAI ZSH plugin** (eventual symbolic behavior detection)
    - **Model fine-tuning datasets** (e.g., Gemma, Pythia forks)
