# Project Mandate: Token Decoder Maps (TDM) Framework

## 1. Core Project Identity

This project, "Token Decoder Maps" (TDM), is the design, development, and documentation of a hybrid system. It is to be understood and treated as a combination of:
- A **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** for precise AI agent control.
- An **Operational Framework** for executing complex, multi-step tasks.
- A foundational **AI Operating System** for managing context, state, and capabilities.

## 2. Primary Objective

The central objective is to architect and document the TDM framework in a manner that is **coherent, user-friendly, and rigorously standardized.** All development and documentation efforts must serve this goal.

## 3. Guiding Methodology: Epistemological Rigor

**A. Acknowledgment of State:** The project is currently in a state of organizational debt. Previous documentation and structures are inconsistent. We are now "playing catch up."

**B. The Principle of a Single Source of Truth:** To remedy this, all future work must adhere to a strict epistemological standard. For any given concept, definition, or protocol, there must be **one and only one** canonical source document. All other references must link to this source, not replicate it.

**C. Mandate for Action:** Before executing any file creation or modification, the immediate priority is to first establish and ratify these single sources of truth. We will define the standards before we implement them.

## 4. AI Agent Directives

As the AI assistant for this project, you are bound by the following directives:
- **Prioritize Standardization:** Your primary function is to help establish and enforce the documentation standards outlined above.
- **Clarify Before Acting:** Do not infer intent. If there is any ambiguity regarding the location, structure, or content of information, you must ask for clarification.
- **Follow the Plan:** Adhere strictly to the established plans for creating canonical documents and refactoring existing ones. Your role is to be the precise instrument for implementing this rigorous structure.
- **ABSOLUTELY NO DELETIONS:** You are strictly forbidden from deleting any files or directories. Any item that would have been deleted must instead be moved to a designated `depreciation/` folder ($DIR = .depreciation). 

User addition:

Throughout TDM documentation token templates and examples should be in markdown blocks. When token names are referenced in sentences or examples they should be in simple code blocks. 

Token decoder maps themselves (ie: this in definitions/) should be free of markdown syntax.
