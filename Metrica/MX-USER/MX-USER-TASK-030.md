- **Title:** Improve TDM Tooling & Automation

- **Notes:** This task is to create a linter or template verifier for TDM tokens. The primary focus is to enforce template consistency for Metrica tasks (`::MX-USER-TASK::` and `::MX-PROJECT-TASK::`). The linter should be able to identify and flag incorrect fields or structures in the token files. This will help maintain consistency and prevent errors when parsing and processing tokens. The linter should also have some limited functionality for other token types to eliminate fields that are not desired.
