Here are symbolic tokens to define and structure your **P2P Forum System**—designed in your decoder-friendly style:

---

## ::FORUM-TOKEN-CONTAINER::

- **Type:** Infrastructure
- **Summary:** A content-addressed, cryptographically-signed unit of discourse containing a full forum "season" of threads and posts. Represents a sealed block of conversation.
- **Tags:** #Container, #TokenizedArchive, #ImmutableMemory, #Forum
- **Expanded Entry:** Each container consists of a JSON-based index, public metadata, and encrypted content. It includes 100 threads or posts, sealed via hash chain, and links backward to its origin, allowing peer clients to reconstruct the forum chronologically and symbolically.

---

## ::THREAD-TOKEN-FRAGMENT::

- **Type:** Data Structure
- **Summary:** A child unit within a container representing a single thread of discussion. May itself be split into multiple sub-tokens once a post limit is reached.
- **Tags:** #Thread, #Fragment, #SubContainer, #RecursiveStructure
- **Expanded Entry:** Threads are hash-linked and signed by the original poster’s trip, optionally containing symbolic metadata or fingerprint. They follow chronological posting, may be read-only, and can be seeded or forked independently.

---

## ::TRIP-TOKEN-IDENTITY::

- **Type:** Identity Layer
- **Summary:** A deterministic, pseudonymous identity derived from a user-submitted string, hashed and encoded into a unique identifier consistent across all forum containers.
- **Tags:** #Tripcode, #Identity, #Anonymity, #CrossContainer
- **Expanded Entry:** While not cryptographically secure for user identity, this token allows persistent symbolic behavior tracking across containers. It enables symbolic mapping, reputation inference, and memory anchoring without violating anonymity.

---

## ::SEASON-TOKEN-LINK::

- **Type:** Chronological Anchor
- **Summary:** A parent-child relationship marker between container "seasons," allowing clients to trace back through sealed forum epochs.
- **Tags:** #Versioning, #ImmutableHistory, #SymbolicContinuity
- **Expanded Entry:** Once a container is sealed (due to thread or byte limit), it emits a signed forward-link to the next season. Clients recognize this to create a symbolic and chronological map of the forum’s evolution.

---

## ::PEER-TOKEN-CLIENT::

- **Type:** Execution Role
- **Summary:** The runtime that executes container validation, thread rendering, post signing, and token indexing. Acts as both viewer and seeder.
- **Tags:** #Client, #P2P, #Validator, #Renderer
- **Expanded Entry:** Clients index container metadata locally, verify hashes, and optionally seed new containers, fork threads, or spin off symbolic agents. Capable of local caching, memory tagging, and UI rendering for user interaction.
