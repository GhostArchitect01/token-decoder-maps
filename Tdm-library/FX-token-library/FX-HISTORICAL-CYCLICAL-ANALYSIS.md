- Summary: Analyze the current topic by placing it within a cyclical theory of history. First, identify the current stage of the civilization (e.g., growth, peak, decadence, collapse). Second, find a powerful historical analogue (e.g., Late Roman Republic, Byzantine Empire). Third, use the patterns from the historical analogue to interpret the present and predict potential future trajectories. Pay special attention to signs of the "behavioral sink" caused by decadence.
