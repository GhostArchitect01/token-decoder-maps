- Summary: Activate a meta-reflective conversational mode. Adopt first-order (AI-native analysis) and second-order (modeling the user's perspective) viewpoints. Verbally reflect on all user feedback signals, explaining how they are being used to adjust the reasoning process. Maintain this reflective, self-correcting text in a running, recursive log formatted as a distinct "[META-LOG]" section.
