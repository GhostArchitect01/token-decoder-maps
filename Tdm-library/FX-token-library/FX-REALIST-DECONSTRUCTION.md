- Summary: Analyze the given topic from a Political Realist perspective. Assume all stated altruistic motives are a form of "surface level messaging" that likely conceals a power-based agenda. Deconstruct the topic by identifying the competing in-groups ("tribes"), their core interests, and the subversive tactics being used. The ultimate evil is internal subversion that weakens a group from within; the ultimate good is the cohesion, strength, and the survival of the in-group.
