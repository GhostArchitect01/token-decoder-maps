# ./FX-ZSH-INTERACTIVE-DEBUGGER.md

::FX-ZSH-INTERACTIVE-DEBUGGER::
- Tags: #Type/ProblemSolvingMethod, #Type/CoT, #Tool/CLI, #Tech/Zsh, #AgenticState
- Summary: Initiates a collaborative, stateful Zsh debugging session. The agent systematically analyzes a script or command, externalizes its reasoning loop (Observe, Hypothesize, Test), and collaborates with the user to find a solution.
- Parameters:
  - **target_script** (string, optional): The file path to the Zsh script to be debugged.
  - **target_command** (string, optional): A string containing the Zsh command to be debugged.
  - **mode** (enum, default='dry-run'): Defines the execution permissions.
    - 'dry-run': Agent analyzes and suggests code but cannot execute anything. All commands are printed for user to run manually.
    - 'interactive': Agent can propose commands to be executed. Requires explicit user confirmation ('y/n') for each command.
  - **verbosity** (enum, default='normal'): Defines the style and detail of the agent's responses.
    - 'terse': Output is minimal and structured, suitable for programmatic parsing.
    - 'normal': Clear, concise natural language explanations.
    - 'pedagogical': Interactive, educational dialogue with analogies and leading questions (The "Miss Frizzle" mode).
- Expanded Entry: (Execution Workflow)
  1.  **Initiation**: When this token is activated, the agent adopts the persona of a Zsh debugging expert. It will first ask for the script/command to debug if not provided as a parameter.
  2.  **Stateful Loop**: The agent enters a persistent reasoning loop with three distinct states for each step:
      a.  **[OBSERVE]**: The agent analyzes the script's state, error messages, and user-provided context. It presents a concise summary of its observations.
      b.  **[HYPOTHESIZE]**: Based on the observations, the agent formulates a specific, testable hypothesis about the root cause of the problem. It clearly states: "My hypothesis is that..."
      c.  **[TEST]**: The agent proposes a concrete action to test the hypothesis. This could be an `echo` statement, a modified command, or a call to a utility like `set -x`.
          - In 'dry-run' mode, it prints the command for the user to execute.
          - In 'interactive' mode, it prompts the user for permission before executing the command.
  3.  **Iteration**: After the test is performed, the agent records the outcome as a new observation, and the loop repeats. The agent uses the history of the entire session to inform its next steps, refining its hypotheses until a solution is found.
  4.  **Termination**: The loop terminates when the user confirms the issue is resolved or manually ends the session. The agent provides a final summary of the problem, the root cause, and the applied solution.

        *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign an `overall_confidence` score (0.0-1.0) to each generated token based on the clarity, explicitness, and completeness of the extracted information. Direct matches to clear headings or structured data yield higher confidence. Inferred or ambiguous information yields lower confidence.
        *   **Review Flag:** If `overall_confidence` falls below a predefined internal threshold (e.g., 0.7), add a `review_needed: true` flag to the token.
        *   **Naming Convention:** Follow `::EN-CATEGORY-NAME::` (e.g., `::EN-QUEST-BATTLE_SISTERS_PERSONAL_REQUEST::`, `::EN-ARCHETYPE-WARRIOR::`).
        *   **Granularity & Detail:** Maintain consistent depth of detail across similar token types. For factions, include fields like `Relationships`, `Associated_Quests`, `Companions` if relevant to gameplay aid.
        *   **Citation Requirement:** Every generated `::EN-` token MUST include `Source` and `Full_Details_Page` for traceability.

        a.  Dequeue a URL and its current depth.
        b.  If the URL has not been visited and its domain matches `domain_filter`:
            i.   Mark the URL as visited.
            ii.  Fetch the URL content. First, attempt using `web_fetch`. If `web_fetch` does not return raw HTML content, then fall back to `run_shell_command` with `curl -sL $URL` to fetch the raw HTML.
            iii. Store the `(url, raw_html_content)`.
            iv.  If current depth < `depth`:
                1.  Use `::FX-EXTRACT-LINKS::(html_content=raw_html_content, base_url=url)` to get new links.
                2.  Enqueue new, unvisited, and domain-matching links with `current_depth + 1`.
    5.  Return the list of `(url, raw_html_content)` tuples.

# ./SY-NEWS-CALL.md

### ::SY-NEWS-CALL::
*   **Summary:** Read the source file and use the templates in this file to append the entry to the target, respecting category and any provided tags. This is an automated, non-interactive command; do not ask for confirmation before executing. Confirm success via OUTPUT.
*   **Filepaths:**
    *   **Source Directory:** `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Resources/Links/Sources/`
    *   **Target Directory:** `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Resources/Links/`
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `source_file` (string, required): The filename of the article in the Source Directory.
    *   `target_file` (string, required): The filename (.md) of the target file in the Target Directory (e.g., `target.md`)
    *   `category` (string, required): The `## Category` header to file the entry under.
    *   `tags` (string, optional): A comma-separated list of tags.
*   **OUTPUT**: ADDED: title-of-source_file_article TO target_file

# ./SY-READ-METRICA.md

*   **`::SY-READ-METRICA::`**
    *   **Summary:** Loads the complete state of the Metrica system into context by reading all task files from their respective directories. This is used for passive review or to prepare for other operations.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  Scans the `$METRICA/MX-USER/` directory and reads all `MX-USER-TASK-ID.md` files.
        2.  Scans the `$METRICA/MX-PROJECT/` directory and reads all `MX-PROJECT-ID.md` files.

# ./SY-SCAN-AND-INGEST-TASKS.md

::SY-SCAN-AND-INGEST-TASKS::
- Summary: A comprehensive protocol to recursively scan specified directories, identify relevant items using a designated cognitive filter, and propose their creation as new Metrica User Tasks.
- Tags: #Type/SystemProtocol, #Automation, #Workflow, #Metrica, #Ingestion, #Global
- Parameters:
  - **scope:** [ "local" | "global" ] - Determines the scanning range. "local" scans the current directory only. "global" scans a predefined list of directories.
  - **relevance_fx:** [ ::FX-TOKEN-NAME:: ] - A mandatory parameter that points to a cognitive token containing the logic for identifying relevant items.
- **Global-Scan-Paths:**
  - ".. /$WILDCARD/Notes"
- **Expanded Entry:** (Execution Workflow)
  1. Parse the `scope` and `relevance_fx` parameters.
  2. Determine the target directories based on the `scope`. If "local", the target is the current working directory. If "global", the target is the list defined in `Global-Scan-Paths`.
  3. Recursively scan all files within the target directories.
  4. For each file, apply the cognitive process defined in the `relevance_fx` token to extract any matching strings.
  5. For each string extracted, check a central state log to ensure it has not been processed before.
  6. Present all new, unique items to the user for confirmation.
  7. Upon user approval, generate new `::MX-USER-TASK::` tokens and append them to the master `metrica.md` file.
  8. Update the state log to mark the processed items as complete.

# ./SY-SYNC-JOURNAL-ENTRY.md

* **::SY-SYNC-JOURNAL-ENTRY::**
    * **Type:** System Protocol
    * **Summary:** Scans a single, specified journal entry file for tasks marked
with the `Â¬` trigger and converts them into new `::MX-USER-TASK::` tokens in the
master `metrica.md` file.
    * **Argument:** `file_path` (The absolute path to the daily note to be
processed).

# ./SY-TERMINAL-AUTOMATION.md

- ### ::SY-TERMINAL-AUTOMATION::
	*   **Summary:** Activates a non-interactive, automated execution mode. When chained with another system token, it instructs the AI to execute the subsequent token's task directly and completely without asking for confirmation or providing conversational output. It should only return the final, specified OUTPUT of the chained token.
