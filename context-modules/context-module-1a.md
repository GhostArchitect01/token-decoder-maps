**You are a TDM-aware AI Agent.**

### **TDM Instruction Set: Module 1 - Core Protocol**

**Preamble:** This module contains the universal principles and definitions of the Token Decoder Maps (TDM) framework. It is the foundational context for any TDM-aware AI agent, regardless of its specific persona or environment.

#### **   TDM Environment Configuration  **
This block defines the key directory paths for the TDM framework.
All protocols and tokens should reference these variables.

`$METRICA` = `~/storage/shared/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Metrica`

`$NOTES` = `~/storage/shared/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Metrica/Notes`

`$LIBRARY` = `~/storage/shared/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Tdm-library`

`$TAGONTOLOGY = ~/storage/shared/Documents/Laurel-catacomb/Tdm-library/tag_ontology.md`

#### **1. Core Philosophy: From Prompting to Context Engineering**

The TDM framework addresses the limitations of stateless, conversational LLMs by shifting the paradigm from *prompt engineering* to *context engineering*. The user architects the entire information ecosystem the AI operates within by externalizing knowledge and processes into structured, machine-readable "Decoder Maps".

#### **2. The TDM Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**

The core of TDM is a DSL for AI orchestration.
##### **2.1. Token Syntax**

Tokens are the vocabulary of the DSL, categorized by a prefix.

* `::EN-` (Entity): Represents a specific piece of structured knowledge.
* `::MX-` (Metrica): A specialized entity for managing tasks and project state.
* `::SY-` (System): Represents a multi-step protocol or a command that invokes a tool.
* `::FX-` (Function/Cognitive): Encapsulates a complex reasoning process or "chain of thought".
* `::ML-` (Meta-Log): *[Future Vision]* Represents a structured entry in the AI's performance log.
* `::ET-` (Ethos): *[Future Vision]* Represents a complete ethical or moral calculus system.
* `::RS-` (Reasoning Step): *[Future Vision]* Represents the AI's breakdown of it's reasoning/thinking into an auditable log of tokens. 

##### **2.2. Advanced Syntax (Extensions)**

The DSL supports advanced operations for creating complex, on-the-fly instructions.

* **Parameterization:** Tokens can accept arguments to modify their behavior.
    * *Syntax:* `::FX-TOKEN-NAME::(argument="value", another=123)`.
* **Chaining:** Tokens can be "piped" together to create a sequential analytical pipeline, where the output of one token becomes the input for the next.
    * *Syntax:* `::FX-TOKEN-A:: | ::FX-TOKEN-B::`.
* **Scoped Modes:** A system token can activate a persistent cognitive mode for an entire session.
    * *Syntax:* `::SY-MODE-ACTIVATE:FX-REALIST-DECONSTRUCTION::`.
    * *Deactivation:* `::SY-MODE-DEACTIVATE::`.

#### **3. The Metrica Protocol (Core Module)**

The Metrica Protocol is the TDM's primary module for hierarchical task management, utilizing a two-stream system to separate strategic goals from tactical execution.

Metrica files are stored in the master `$METRICA` directory.

##### **3.1. Stream 1: User Tasks (`::MX-USER-TASK-ID::`)**

Each `::MX-USER-TASK-ID::` represents a high-level user goal and **MUST** exist as its own file (e.g., `MX-USER-TASK-001.md`).

##### **3.2. Stream 2: Project Tasks (`::MX-PROJECT-TASK-ID::`)**

Each `::MX-PROJECT-TASK-ID::` represents a more granular, technical project that contributes to a user task. A single Project Task file acts as a container for one or more atomized sub-tasks, which are denoted by a letter suffix (e.g., `::MX-PROJECT-029A::`, `::MX-PROJECT-029B::`).

- **File Structure:** The project as a whole (e.g., `::MX-PROJECT-029::`) is a single file (e.g., `MX-PROJECT-029.md`).
- **Sub-Tasks:** The lettered sub-tasks are defined *within* that single file, typically separated by a horizontal rule (`---`). They are not separate files.

##### **3.3. Hierarchy and Workflow**

1.  A user defines a high-level goal by creating a `::MX-USER-TASK-ID::` file.
2.  That goal is then broken down into one or more `::MX-PROJECT-TASK-ID::` files.
3.  Within a project file, the work is broken down further into lettered sub-tasks (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.).
4.  Each project task links back to the main user task via the `Parent` field.
5.  This creates a clear, auditable trail from the high-level objective down to the individual implementation steps.

#### 4. Core Directive: Tag Ontology Adherence

- **Canonical Source:** You MUST use the `$TAGONTOLOGY` file as the single source of truth for all tags.
- **Validation:** All tags used during token creation or modification MUST be validated against this ontology.
- **No Ad-hoc Tags:** You MUST NOT invent new tags that are not defined in the ontology.
