## Token Naming Convention and Glossary

All custom tokens used within this system will adhere to a fixed prefix convention to clearly categorize their purpose. This aids both human readability and the AI's ability to consistently interpret and apply token-specific logic.

For the canonical definitions of each token type, please refer to the [TDM Language Specification](TDM_Language_Specification.md).
