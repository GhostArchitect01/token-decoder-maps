Warrant of Trade: Revokable only by the Lord Regant and a vote by the High Lords of Terra. Almost unrestrained freedom and autonomy in all matters. Exclusive (and a source of great distrust for many in the Imperium) permission to deal with the xenos and the rogue (but untainted) bastions of mankind. Exclusive rights over worlds, salvage, resources, artifacts, relics, derelict ships, space lanes, archeotech and xeno technologies which they discover and lay claim to. The Warrant of Trade itself is considered a holy relic of unfathomable value. Militant Charter: Grants the right to wage war against all those who oppose the interests of the Imperium or refuse the Emperor. Grants the right to maintain sufficient power and resources to carry out wars of faith and Conquest. The Charter itself is considered a holy relic of unfathomable value. Achille-Myrmea The Forge of Achille-Myrmea was powerful and ambitious, commanding an impressive shipyard and Titan Legion. The millenia of partnership with the house Myrmidea and the Rogue Trader Militant that always sat upon it's throne had softened them. They were greedy for human archeotech and opportunities to explore it's applications. Together, they were a powerful duo. Their shipyards slaved endlessly on vessels for the Rogue Trader Militant Dynasty, the Myrmiead. The resources of the Myrmidea Cluster and Chalybaean Asteroid Field made them a formidable industrial power, but with the weight of resources House Myrmidea could bring them, they could be counted amongst the elite forge worlds. They received vital exclusive access to study the discoveries, treasures, and timeless artifacts and relics of House Myrmidea.
