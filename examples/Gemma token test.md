- Tags: #Imperium #ForgeWorld #AdeptusMechanicus #RogueTrader #Industry
- Expanded Entry: The Forge of Achille-Myrmea, softened by millennia of partnership with House Myrmidea, was greedy for human archeotech and opportunities to explore its applications. Together, they were a powerful duo. Their shipyards slaved endlessly on vessels for the Rogue Trader Militant Dynasty, the Myrmidea. The resources of the Myrmidea Cluster and Chalybaean Asteroid Field made them a formidable industrial power, and with the weight of resources House Myrmidea could bring them, they could be counted amongst the elite forge worlds. They received vital exclusive access to study the discoveries, treasures, and timeless artifacts and relics of House Myrmidea.
